<p>How to make scrambled eggs</p>
<p>Materials and ingredients needed:</p>
<p> medium sized frying pan</p>
<p>fork or whisk (mixing tool)</p>
<p>large bowl or beaker</p>
<p>Solid flat spatula</p>
<p>Butter knife</p>
<p>2-3 eggs</p>
<p>Butter</p>
<p>1. Put the pan on the over burner and turn it to medium heat. (5-7 notch)</p>
<p>2. Scrape a small blob of butter on the pan.</p>
<p>3. Tilt the pan around so the butter coats the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p>4. Crack your eggs into the bowl.</p>
<p>5. Beat and stir the eggs thoroughly until they are a yellow paste.</p>
<p>6. Pour the egg paste into the pan.</p>
<p>7. Turn up the burner temperature, but donâ€™t turn it to the max temperature.</p>
<p>8. Push and scrape the eggs around the pan with the spatula.</p>
<p>9. When they are solid, flip the eggs over and scrape the sides.</p>
<p>10. When the eggs are solid and clumped together, and have minimal reflective surfaces (not browned though) the eggs are ready to take off the burner.</p>
<p>11. Turn off the burner and keep pushing and flipping the eggs as they cool down, until there is a plate ready.12. Put on seasoning (optional) and serve.</p>
